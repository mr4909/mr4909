# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mari Alexandria Roberts

**Data Science Manager | Criminal Justice Reform | Visual Storyteller**

I use data to drive system transformation â€” building scalable tools, designing public dashboards, and making justice system data more actionable, equitable, and human-centered.

## âš¡ What I focus on:
- Building reproducible pipelines and R packages for research and policy teams
- Developing public-facing dashboards (Shiny, Quarto, Netlify)
- Creating accessible, high-impact data visualizations and reports
- Driving transparency, quality, and innovation in justice system data work

## ðŸŒŸ Selected Projects:
- **Supervision Violations Dashboard (Public Tool)**  
  Built an interactive dashboard in R Shiny coordinating 50 state DOCs' data submissions.
- **Justice System Codebook Generator (Internal Tool)**  
  Developed a reusable R package to automate codebook creation and improve research reproducibility.
- **New Hampshire JRI Slide Decks (Internal Visual Storytelling)**  
  Designed full visual storytelling decks for policymakers to drive criminal justice reform.

> _Much of my work is private due to the sensitivity of justice system and health data. I'm always happy to discuss my experience and approach._
